This is the code repository for [Secure Continuous Delivery on Google Cloud](https://www.packtpub.com/product/secure-continuous-delivery-on-google-cloud/9781805129288?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781805129288), published by Packt.

**Implement an automated and secure software delivery pipeline on Google Cloud using native services**

## What is this book about?
The book discusses specific Google Cloud service or tools used to accomplish a specific task of a continuous delivery pipeline (like code, build, store artifacts, deploy, etc.) in separate chapters. Youâ€™ll learn how to execute exercises related to the different tasks through examples. Finally, you'll be able to use all the tools together to create an end-to-end pipeline in a sample application.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create an end-to-end continuous delivery pipeline using Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Deploy
* Develop, build, and deploy container-based applications with Skaffold and Cloud Code
* Experiment with AI-assisted code generation in Cloud Code
* Automate continuous integration with Cloud Build triggers
* Automate deployment on GKE and Cloud Run through Cloud Deploy
* Enhance pipeline security with Artifact Analysis, Binary Authorization, and SLSA
* Apply best practices, including logging and monitoring

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
[{
"id" : "upstream1",
"repository" : "projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/
repositories/python-local",
"priority" : 100
},
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for DevOps, Platform, and Cloud Engineers tasked with managing application deployment and creating continuous delivery pipelines who want to automate workflows in a fully managed, scalable, and secure platform. Software developers involved in application delivery and interested in harnessing Google Cloud tools to optimize development flow status and feedback loop will also find this book useful. Prior knowledge of Google Cloud fundamentals (including Cloud APIs and IAM), software delivery, containerization, and Kubernetes will enhance the reading experience.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
